            <p class="lab-desc-a">In lab one, we are supposed to use the <a href=
                "https://www.randomlists.com/nouns?dup=false&qty=3">Random Lists 
                Random Noun Generator </a> to find 3 random nouns and make a website 
                based on them. My random nouns were:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pets</li>
                <li>Wash</li>
                <li>Recess</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="lab-desc-b">The way that I will use these three words together 
                will be for washing pets during recess. I'm not the most creative so
                I hope this much will suffice.

                        Guess who else has a ton of extra energy? That's right, kids!
                        Not to mention, just like dogs, kids love to play <span class=
                        "italicized">(they have a specific time for it every day)</span>. 
                        That includes playing with water... and suds.

                    You can probably guess where this is going. I propose a new way
                    of making sure your pooch gets clean, free of cost and <span 
                    class="bolded">mostly</span> morally gray. Kids would just <span 
                    class="bolded">love</span> to spend some time with your dog. So what 
                    if we were to let kids get their energy out by washing our dogs during 
                    recess time- free of cost while also supplying a fun activity to
                    children? I, for one, think it's a great idea.
